# Assignment3
#TASK1
In this program we have used recursion to find the factorial of anumber passed to a function named factorial and the input is taken from user.
Once the number is passed to the function it ist checks if the number is zero so will return 1 as answer otherwise it moves to the else block where we keep on calling the factorial function recursively and once it reaches the condiotn of n=0, it startes recursively falling
back to the answers and get us the factorial of a number.
finally we print the answer in the print statement.




#TASK2
The very first thing that we have done here is that we importted the math module to use sqrt(), log() and sin() fucntion.
In this program we have defined a function math_fun and pass a number as a parameter whose value is taken from user using input funtion.
Once the value is passed it calculates the sqrt, log and sin using the math module and prints it.
